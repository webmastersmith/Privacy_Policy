## Amazon-Sort: Privacy policy

Welcome to the Amazon-Sort for Chrome, Firefox and Brave browser extension.

This is an extension by Bryon Smith.

As an avid Chrome user myself, I take privacy very seriously.
I know how irritating it is when extensions collect your data without your knowledge.

I hereby state, to the best of my knowledge and belief, that I have not programmed this extension to collect any personally identifiable information. All data (e.g., extension preferences) created by you (the user) is stored on your device only, and can be simply erased by clearing the extension's data or uninstalling it.

|    `scripting`    | The scripting permission is required for our extension to programmatically inject Javascript into the Amazon web pages that the user is actively viewing. This allows sorting and displaying prices and product comparisons. This functionality activates only when the user engages with the extension, ensuring it is a user-driven action. The scripts do not modify the underlying functionality of the webpage nor collect any personal information, focusing solely on enhancing the user's shopping experience by providing valuable insights and comparisons. |
| `host permission` | The host permissions requested by our extension are essential for its operation on Amazon web pages. These permissions enable the extension to apply content scripts specifically to Amazon's domain, allowing us to extract product information such as prices, images and product information directly from the Amazon product page. This process runs only in your browser and does not involve tracking user behavior or collecting personal information.                                                                                                         |
